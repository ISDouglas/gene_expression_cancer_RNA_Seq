This is a project that using maching learning to analyse the different gene expression on cancer samples.

1. 'Projet_Biostat3.ipynb': 
   The whole model codes on the google collab notebook format for this project, the datasets(data.rar and labels.csv in this file) are loaded through url links in this notebook. 

   3 methods to run it in google collab:
   
   (1) Use link : https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TzyChu79mOtpb5Du_TLLuKqmXwthzJbG?usp=sharing
   
   (2) click on the 'Open In Collab' at the head of the code.
      
   (3) download the .Ipynb file
   
   Running the whole codes can take about 10 mins.

3. 'Test_on_features_selection_Biostat3.ipynb'
   Code for testing number of estimators, number of estimators = 10 turns to be the minimum number of estimators to achieve the optimal performance, at this number, 193 features (genes) are selected in this project, nearly the number of test datasets. 

   To get access by link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gRmUqyv82zB1hUHP9et7mjCAFFA-9I5A?usp=sharing

   Running the whole codes can take about 7 mins.

4. data.rar and labels.csv: resource files of datasets
