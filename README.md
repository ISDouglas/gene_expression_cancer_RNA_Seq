1. 'Projet_Biostat3.ipynb': 
   The whole model codes on the google collab notebook format for this project, the datasets(data.rar and labels.csv in this file) are loaded through url links in this notebook. 
   To run it in google collab, you can download the .Ipynb file or just click on the 'Open In Collab' at the head of the code.     
   Running the whole codes can take about 10 mins.

2. 'Test_on_featrues_selection_Biostat3.ipynb': 
   For the test on features selection using random forest method, finally, number of estimators = 10 turns to be the minimum number of estimators to achieve the optimal performance, at this number, 193 features (genes) are selected in this project, nearly the number of test datasets. 
   Running the whole codes can take about 7 mins.

3. data.rar and labels.csv: resource files of datasets
